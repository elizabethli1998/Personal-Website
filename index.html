                        My name is Elizabeth (Lizzy) Li. I am currently studying at Iowa State University, finished with my undergrad in software engineering and
                        am currently pursuing a minor in Leadership Studies. I would consider myself to be a passionate and ambitious individual who strongly
                        emphasizes the importance of communication, leadership, and teamwork. My time at ISU has taught me invaluable topics,
                        but I would have to say that the most I have learned was through my work experience at several internships. Although I am a programmer,
                        I am also passionate about writing, art, and design. All of the aforementioned have led me to have a strong interest
                        in Game Development, as I most recently completed an internship as an Animation Engineering Intern with EA and have completed
                        a UI Engineering internship with Ubisoft in summer 2019. My other experiences and interests
                        involve Android and web development on the frontend side.

            <h4>Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering with a minor in Leadership Studies</h4>
            <p>
                During my college career, I have picked up on fundamental software development concepts such as data structures, algorithms, project management, and much more.
                In addition to taking rigorous coursework, I have served as a peer mentor for Leadership through Engineering Academic Diversity (LEAD) for three years for
                underrepresented first year engineering minorities. I have led groups of at least 7 mentees in the past and I strive to provide them with a clear pathway
                to success. Furthermore, I am a member of Computer Science and Software Engineering Club, Women in Science and Engineering, Digital Women, and have
                played a role as Outreach Chair for Game Development Club for two years.

              <p>
                  My most recent work experience in the game industry was on the Frostbite Animation team. My biggest project consisted of enhancing the usability an animation tool in EA's Maya plugin
                  and extending that tool's capabilities to Frostbite's properitary animation engine using C# and WPF. As an animation engineer, I had to work closely with animators, riggers, and artists and frequently
                  present my updates to the tools to them to get their feedback and iterate accordingly. This was also my first remote experience and despite the challenges of working from home, I was able to make a
                  vast amount of contributions to the team.

                <p>
                    My first work experience in the game industry consisted of primarily building UI for unannounced projects for more than one team, designing levels, debugging when necessary,
                    building diagrams, and writing concise documentation. I worked with Ubisoft's proprietary engine, utilizing the feats of C++, visual programming,
                    JIRA, Perforce, and Visual Studio. A vast majority of my work has been alongside fellow game designers, level designers, UI/UX teams, and other
                    programmers. In addition, I participated in a Game Jam/Hackathon where I had to build a game in Unreal with no prior experience.

                    My experience at this cloud-based company mainly consisted of web and mobile development. I had to build various types of web applications using mostly
                    JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and a bit of SQL, C#, and ASP.NET. About less than half way into the internship, I was placed on the Mobile Team, where I
                    developed an Android App that acted as a custom Formbuilder that connected to its web counterpart, using Java, XML, and some PHP and JSON.

                     a lot for myself to pick up. I had to learn JavaScript, HTML, and CSS with little to no prior experience with any of them, but managed to contribute
                     and play a part in the frontend side of the web-based learning game.

                        <p>
                            Garden of Eden is a game developed in Unreal Engine, during a 36-hour time-span at a Game Jam/Hackathon while I was an
                            intern at Ubisoft. I was placed on a team of three, where myself and my teammates had to learn the engine on our own, as
                            all of us were new to it. After drafting out the plans for the game and the minimum viable product, a lot of research and
                            quick learning was necessary in order to complete a game in the alloted time.

                            My jobs for this project included being the Project Manager, helping to create timeframes and tasks for my team in order to
                            get the job done. I also was responsible for building levels and dabbling into Level Design, animation, Gameplay implementation, and building
                            mechanics. Eventually, we were able to build a 2D platformer game that integrated the usage of AI, triggering mechanics, and the
                            concept of puzzles and finish it with time to spare.

                            worked on the flip animations and had a Squirtle character cheer on the player using different animation behaviors by implementing

                            <p>
                                Rush is a web-based game built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It was built with a team of four over the course of three weeks.
                                The objective of the game is to get through a 2D dungeon and progress through every level by bypassing enemies that block your path.
                                Items will be scattered around the dungeon and collecting them can harm or help you. My role was to add the mechanics, game rules,
                                time, and healthbars.

                            <p>
                                As part of the Mobile team at my internship at Buildertrend, I was tasked to build a custom web formbuilder
                                made with JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Bootstrap, Angular, PHP, and JSON, where users could drag and drop form elements
                                onto their custom forms. Such forms would appear the exact same way on the Android component, using Java and JSON
                                to deserialize the data as it would be passed between platforms. This was the first time where I had to do fullstack
                                development, as I did the Frontend and Client-side as well as the Server-side with PHP and JSON. In addition, my partner
                                and I had to make the web-app compatible with both Android and iOS.
